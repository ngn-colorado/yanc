# Yanc

Yanc is a collection of programs which make up a software defined
network (SDN) control plane. The core component of Yanc is a
schema-based filesystem. Also included in this repository are an
OpenFlow driver, a Bro driver, and some basic SDN applications.

Over the next couple of weeks, we will import each component into this
repository.
